----------Code refactoring----------
Steps in completing the assignment

In the beginning, as we saw in our courses, the first question that we need to answer when analyzing over a code snippet is
"Am I able to understand the code easily?" If the answer is no, then we have to refactor the code in order to be as suggestive as possible.
Looking over our code, we can observe that it needs some changes regarding the names, leading us to the first step:
	Step 1- Use Intention-Revealing Names
		->we will create a new package called ro.ase.cts.g1099.models, where we will move our Account class
		->rename the following class variables in the following way: 
						-loan_value to loanValue
						-account_Type to accountType
						-rate to rateValue
		->rename the getters & setters to be more suggestive -> getLoanValue() & setLoanValue()
		->rename setLoanValue() and constructor parameters (value) to be more suggestive -> loanValue
		->rename to_string() function using name conventions -> toString()
 		->rename the calculate() function to be more suggestive -> calculateTotalFee()
 		->rename the print() function to -> printStatement()

After we've renamed our variables & methods, we also need to check the code to see if it's easy to understand, as it can be confusing.
How can we do that? By going through step 2:
	Step 2- Make sure the code formatting is applied
		->move the constructor at the beginning of the class for having a clearer view
		->move the toString @Override at the end of the class
		->move the getLoanValue() and setLoanValue() after the constructor
		->re-align the code to be easier to read (CTRL+ALT+F)
		->remove useless comments

By performing steps 1&2, our code looks already cleaner and it's more intuitive, already fulfilling some basic clean code concepts, such as:
												"The code must be easy to read"
																&
											  "The code must be easy to understand".
We also need to have in mind that we always have to use enums instead of constants, leading us to step 3:
	Step 3- Remove statics and use enum
		->create an enum called AccountType and define the types that an account can take;
		->make sure to link the AccountType enum with the Account class by creating a private variable private AccountType accountType
		(and delete the old one)
		->make sure to also modify the constructor
			
	Step 4- Create an interface
		->create a new package with an interface called MonthlyRateInterface as we need to refer to objects by their interfaces
		->modify the Account class by adding "implements MonthlyRateInterface" in the class defining
		
We also need to format out functions:		
	Step 5- Check the functions and their returns
		->modify the return of the following functions:
			-setLoanValue()
			-getLoanValue()
			-the public constructor
				by adding this. to each return
		->modify the getMonthlyRate() function to also display to the console the monthly rate by adding: 
				"System.out.println("The monthly rate is " + loanValue * rateValue)"
		->add a setRate() method (as we only have the getRate() method)
		->add getter&setter for the daysActive variable;
		->remove int temp = 365; from calculateTotalFee() function
		->remove the printStatement method
		->we need to make sure that our functions are as short as possible, performing one action only!
					
	Step 6- Managing exceptions
		-> create a new package for managing custom exceptions rather than standard exceptions:
			->for managing the loanValue we will create a class called InvalidLoanValException (also make sure to modify in the Account class)
			->for managing the rateValue we will create a class called InvalidRateValException (also make sure to modify in the Account class)
			->create a class called InvalidArgumentException which extends Exception 
	
	And now this is it, our code looks better. Of course, it is room for more changes, making it even simpler than this.
	--Final note:		
	*We also need to split the calculateTotalFee function in 2 or even 3 functions, as it is too complex.
	We should have a function which checks for the type of the account, if it is premium or super premium, and maybe another function who
	concludes the final total value, but I'm not sure how to implements those 2 :').
